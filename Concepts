Computer network in data communication, a physical network node may either be a data communication equipement such as a modem, hub, bridge, or switch; or a digital telephone 
handset, a printer or a host computer(e.g.., a router, a workstation or a server), If the network in question is a LAN or WAN, every LAN or WAN node must have a MAC address, 
typically one for each network interface controller it possesses.

note * a hub constitues a physical network node, but doesn't constitute a LAN network, since a hubbed network logically is a bus network. Analogously, a repeater or PSTN modem
is a physical network node but not a LAN node in this sense.

A digital signal is a signal that has defined levels.

An analog signal is a signal that can take any value within the given limit.

modulator comes from the word modulate, meaning to alter the frequency of(an electromagnetic wave or other oscillation) in accordance with the variations of a second signal, typ
-ically one of a lower frequency.

demodulator comes from the word demodulate, meaning to extract the modulating signal from it's carrier.
